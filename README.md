# Swarm-Creation-Guide

## Is it time to split the Hive?

### Background

This is a guide for potential hosts to run a Swarm event. This is distributed under an open source licence model.

The aecHIVE community has held its first event in Dublin, November 2019 to great success. Referred to as the "Swarm", it is the physical event that brings people together. We are open sourcing what it takes to run a Swarm so you can adopt the structure and hit the ground running with a *101* style guide for organising one and how it fits in with the overall community platform vision.

### What is a Swarm and its relationship to the aecHIVE?

Swarms can happen simultaneously anywhere in the world and are a representation of a snapshot in time, where geographically localised aecHIVE community members can work on projects collocated. Swarms encompass the characteristics of the aecHIVE community and they are an open and safe environment where competitors, users and partners can resolve wider industry problems and unite behind the same cause.

### Why Swarm (Bees do it!)

The opening night on the inaugural event saw John Bennett from Autodesk Ireland take to the stage to give a welcome speech and share a lovely analogy from his time as a qualified beekeeper with the crowd. He noted the following:

* He could predict a swarm would happen one hour in advance of it due to the hum of activity. He compared this with the anticipation he had for the event.

* Up to 30,000 bees could swarm at the same time in perfect unison. He noted that this level of organised chaos amounted to success.

* That each individual bee thinks not of itself but for the greater good of the swarm and would be willing to risk their life for it. John mentioned this last point was not essential to a successful aecHIVE Swarm. 

These points set the stage for this project, and I noted the following points:

### No actually, what's in it for us as the host?

The aecHIVE Swarm model is open source meaning that it can be forked and used as you require. It will strengthen your localised community and the relationships between innovators. You can respond to localised community innovation needs.

* Don't recreate the wheel - Use an existing event model.

* Become recognised as localised community leader in innovation.

* aecHIVE supports you with the platform required to get you up and running.

* aecHIVE provides a legal entity that offers the financial resources that you require for handling sponsorship money etc.

### Why Open Source Swarm?

* Open source means that anyone can take this model, run it, iterate and feedback.

* First of its kind event model for AECO industries.

* The value of the community is in the connections. We believe that if we can make the model open and accessible, we can enable more Swarm events and as a result, grow the value offered to the community.

* Opening the source for the event model will allow the community to help us engineer, distribute, test and validate the model. We want this to be owned by the community and grown to suit their needs. 

### Guidelines for Swarming

* This is a grassroots movement. We are individuals at events. Companies and status should be left at the door.

* No exclusivity. Open to everyone.

* Enjoy yourself.

* Please provide good coffee.

### What aecHIVE would like from you?

* Help us spread the word and build support for the aecHIVE community.

* Help us onboard new partners that can help your locality.

* There will be another Swarm in your localisation.

* Contribute to the Swarm project if you think you can improve on it.

### What are the value propositions for registering/ attending a Swarm cluster?

* A great opportunity to apply focus to an area of work with others.

* An opportuity to meet the local community with with similar interests.

### What is the aecHIVE community platform?

* Global, online, always available group of innovators in AEC.

* A resource for support.

* A Slack group.

* A website with information about aecHIVE including planned Swarms.

* Dev.to - Feedback on ideas. Discussion forum. Blogging. Topics/ Tags? (Future)

### What can aecHIVE offer your clusters?

* Use of the existing slack groups. Upon registration of a cluster a private slack channel is created for it.

* Guidelines for what cluster can constitute.

* Guidelines for cluster to protect ideas?

* Guidelines for a cluster leader?

## Ready to Swarm? Lets go!

Welcome! So you've decided to organise your own Swarm. There are a few basics to this event planning that we have included in this guide. If you feel we have missed anything, please let us know! We want this guide to be as informative as possible. 

### Goals and objectives. What is your Swarms’ purpose?

aecHIVE was created as a space like-minded and innovative people could come together and build new ideas. The purpose of a Swarm is to have a physical meeting place for ideas to be born. The unique aspect of aecHIVE is these ideas will continue past the Swarm and evolve, with clusters staying in contact. 

Decide what you would like your Swarms purpose to be. Would you like people to suggest their own cluster ideas or do you have a specific theme in mind? (could be goals specific, discipline specific etc).

### Date of Event

The first thing to decide! We would strongly recommend you hold your Swarm over a weekend.  You want to leave enough time to plan the event - we would suggest 3 months minimum - this is to leave enough time to plan and market your Swarm.

Before you book the date check around that time to see if any other event in the same or similar industry is clashing. Depending on where you are certain times of the year will be busier than others.

### Location

This is completely up to you as the creator of the Swarm where to hold it. You can either have it where you live, where you work or in the nearest/capital City. We would recommend holding it somewhere that is accessible and convenient for people that may be travelling from afar. Having hotels/restaurants/shops nearby is a good incentive. 

### Venue

You need to find a suitable venue. Have an idea in your head about potential Swarm numbers and look for a venue that will be able to accommodate everyone. You want the room to look full. If you already have a host at this stage they may know some suitable places. 

Swarm Dublin (for example) used the event space in Autodesks’ offices. This space was readily available but not all places would be the same (or provide the venue for free). As with the location, pick a venue that is not too isolated and relatively easy for people to get to or stay near. 

Think about what you might need from the venue and write a checklist. (This will change over time). Next, arrange a meeting with the facilities manager (if the building has one) of the venue you wish to hold your Swarm in. (This person will probably have their own checklist/set of questions). If the building does not have one ask the front desk/office manager/venue manager who would be best to liaise with. 

If you already have a host at this stage they may be of help in finding a venue and you can communicate with them on the following checklist.

Here an example checklist:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Access/Security</td>
    <td>Where is the event being held? If ground floor will there be a security presence or doorman and if so will this be supplied by the building/company or will it have to be contracted out? If it is not on the ground floor is there lift access? Fire escape routes? Will you need a pass to gain entry to the building or operate the lifts?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Audio/Visual Capabilities</td>
    <td>Does the venue have a presentation screen and microphones you can use?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Availability</td>
    <td>Times for set up/use/breakdown/cleaning. Get a schedule of the times you will be using the venue before you have a meeting. Do these times work? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Electrical Power</td>
    <td>Check to see what the socket situation is in the potential venue. Will everyone be on their individual laptops? You may need multiple charging stations or extension sockets.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Fee</td>
    <td>Is there a cost to hire the venue?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Floor Furniture</td>
    <td>Can the venue provide adequate tables and chairs? Do they have whiteboards or would all the above need to be outsourced? Will you want a stage & podium for the presentations on the last day? If so can the venue provide one?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Internet/WiFi</td>
    <td>Does the building/company have their own WiFi you can use? What will you be needing the internet for - typically any kind of ‘live feed’ uses a lot of bandwidth and may need its own connection. However general connections and presentations should be fine.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Marketing Material</td>
    <td>Can you put your own material up at the venue?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Tea/Coffee/Consumables</td>
    <td>Does the venue have a cafe and will it be open? Can you get takeaway food delivered and does the building/company have nightly cleaners or can they supply bins for you to clean up? Will you need to get a catering company in? Can the venue provide tea/coffee?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Travel</td>
    <td>Travel to and from the venue - are there transport links? Does the venue have details of the nearest airport/train/bus/taxi? If not you will have to map this document. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Videographer/Photographer</td>
    <td>Can the venue provide/recommend one? If not you will have to outsource. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Waste Facilities </td>
    <td>Does the venue have its’ own cleaning team that will clean each night? If not do they have anyone they use on a regular basis they could recommend?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>WC Facilities</td>
    <td>Does the venue have adequate WC facilities for the amount of attendees? Male/Female/Disabled. Do they get cleaned between days?</td>
  </tr>
</table>


### Put your team together & find a host

Who would you like to help you plan this event? Now is the time to find a host (a host is not essential!). Hosts can be beneficial as they will bring experience and (potentially) sponsors to your Swarm. The original Swarm Event held in Dublin, Ireland, had [CiTa](https://www.cita.ie/) as its’ hosts. We recommend choosing a host that is interested and supports SMEs, innovation and the Construction Industry as a whole.

### Your budget

*Option 1*

aecHIVE has a fund for first time Swarms. This will cover your venue, vendors and marketing. If you secure extra funding though sponsors that would be fantastic but for first time Swarms it will not be needed. 

### Website & Social Media

Before contacting possible sponsors have your event listed on the [aecHIVE](https://www.aechive.net) website, which will play host to your Swarm. Here people will be able to register a cluster idea, join clusters, find out general information surrounding your Swarm and ask their own questions on the community forum. 

aecHIVE have a [Slack workspace](aechive.slack.com) that all registered members of the website get added to - there you can create your own Channels with your own swarm/cluster members. 

We recommend using social media as a tool for your Swarm. The original Swarm used Twitter, Linkedin, Facebook and Github as the main outlets to advertise and share information and to drum up excitement.

### Sponsors

Before you contact possible sponsors have a think about what you can offer them, i.e. have a sponsor package ready. If you already have a host at this point they might have their own contacts/companies that will sponsor. Offer different types of sponsorship packages and have these available on the website so potential sponsors can see. Swarm Dubin 2019 offered the following sponsor packages:

* *CATERING Support €250*

Benefits for the aecHIVE include:

* Recognition as a supporter at the Friday Social Event, the Saturday Hackathon and the Sunday Mini-conference

* Includes the registration of one cluster Team up to 10 people

* Company logo on aecHIVE website and on CitA’s event Page

* Company 1 meter pull up at the event within the hackathon space where tea/coffee take place.

* *FINANCIAL Support €500*

Benefits for the aecHIVE include:

* Recognition as a financial supporter at the Friday Social Event, the Saturday Hackathon and the Sunday Mini-conference.

* Opportunity to introduce yourself and your company to the delegates

* Company logo featured prominently on all marketing material produced for the aecHIVE.

* Includes the registration of one cluster Team up to 10 people

* Company logo on aecHIVE website and on CitA’s event Page

* Company stand at the event within the hackathon space where tea/coffee take place.

* *PREMIUM Sponsorship €1,000*

Benefits for the aecHIVE include:

* Recognition as a premium sponsor at the Friday Social Event, the Saturday Hackathon and the Sunday Mini-conference.

* Opportunity to introduce yourself and your company to the delegates

* Includes the registration of one cluster Team up to 10 people

* Company logo featured prominently on all marketing material produced for the aecHIVE.

* Company logo on aecHIVE website and on CitA’s event Page

* Company stand at the event within the hackathon space where tea/coffee takes place.

NB - Many companies will have their budget finalised at the beginning of the year for the next 12 months, so if you are holding an event closer to the end of the year give the proposed sponsor as much notice as possible, as there will be less money available towards the end of the year.

Be strategic when approaching potential sponsors - in the UK & Ireland June, July and August are typically summer months when key people take their holidays so these months possibly would not be an ideal time for securing sponsorship.  

### Vendors

Have a think about your Swarm and what you want the weekend to include - will there be alcohol, a pizza part, just some nibbles or are you going to offer a three-course meal? Some routine vendors to think about would be an event planning company, a cleaning company, a photographer/videographer, catering and (possible)bartender*. The venue you have chosen might have their own vendors they can recommend at discounted rates and some might be included with the venue (e.g. the cleaning team).

*NB - A venues requirements might change considerably if you want alcohol to be served. 

### Speakers

Speakers can attract a larger audience - especially to your opening night. The right speaker will capture and inspire their audience and really make an impact. If you have chosen a specific theme for your Swarm pick a speaker with the right expertise that can be informative to your clusters. 

For example at the Dublin Swarm the opening night speakers included Autodesks BIM & Cloud Collaboration technologies expert (the event was held at the Autodesk event space), a speaker from the Host organisation (CiTa) and one from Dublin City Council. These speakers were somewhat strategically chosen - their content was relevant and interesting - but it was also a nod of thanks to the venue, host and city the event was held in. 

The speakers on the ‘Hack’ day (the Saturday) were from Enterprise Ireland and NSAI and were chosen as they provided relevant information for startups and SME companies - on grants/support and National/International Standards respectively. 

Usually speakers will be free of charge but they might expect their expenses (travel, accommodation, meals etc) paid for. It is usual to give a speaker a specified time slot.

You will need a ‘chairperson’ - someone who will oversee the evening, introduce the speakers and if necessary, close the evening. As the host this might be something you do.

### Marketing

### Extras

1. A person to ‘help out’ on the day. Most likely you will need someone to keep everything running smoothly and ready so attendees can self serve. This would include keeping water, tea & coffee topped up, making sure there are enough cups, plates & napkins etc, taking the morning register, giving out name badges, doing shop runs for supplies, keeping drinks/food/beer chilled etc  

### Before the Swarm

* Send out a programme for the weekend

### Swarm Opening Night

* Registration Desk with 

    * Sticky name tags (save money - save good name tags for main event) - name tags have the cita and aecHIVE logos

    * Checklist of people attending 

    * Pens / Marker for name tags

* Coat Rail and hangers

* Table cloths, plates and napkins in yellow & black - HIVE colours

* Table with beer, soft drinks, water, crisps and pizza

* Company popups

* Cluster team names on each assigned table and up on wall

* Give out WiFi password

* Tape and leads to the ground (H&S)

### Hack Day 2 / Mini Conference

*Challenge Questions*

As the host to the Dublin Swarm we are interested in asking you a few questions about your experience:

1. What did you find the biggest challenge?

Lack of time, time of the year (lots of events have happened in the last few weeks, september, October & November are really busy months). End of November/December might be better. Maybe one before summer and one before Christmas? 

Different countries would have different times of the year that are more or less suitable - so check!

2. How do you feel that aecHIVE could have better assisted you?

CiTa had to spend a lot of time re-doing the website as information was missing (no detailed programme), paid event/tickets (if paid websites need to be linked - CiTa had aecHIVE website linked to join the clusters etc but aecHIVE site had not mentioned CiTa or sponsorship/sponsorship packages.

More help given to cluster leaders to find members/help them in any other way. If there had been more time we could have promoted the clusters so more people would have seen them and possibly joined. 

3. What value has running the Dublin Swarm done for Cita?

Next year CiTa are running lots of Tech events so it was good for them to see Mercury (one of their member companies) and Evercam. Good experience for them. 

4. From your experienced today so far how could the Swarm event have been improved?

More people. However as the first event, now the ice has been broken and the people that attended will spread the word. Get the attendees to give feedback and we could use in the next marketing campaign. Always think about the next event re feedback.

5. Could the aecHIVE offer Cita any assistance going forward with regards to this swarm? (Tweeting/blog post etc)

CiTa have been tweeting throughout the weekend and early next week will send out an email after event - thank you for attending, photos, project, feedback

6. How do you envision the future relationship with Cita and aecHIVE?

Need to sit down and figure out what aecHIVE wants to achieve for the next event. E.g. Prizes that are relevant to the event.  

7. Top three tips for future hosts?

1. Focus on what you would like to achieve - do you want people all working on projects?

2. Get  sponsor that relates to the event.

3. Time! Time is key :) and be very organised - hold meetings, do to-do lists and  assign tasks to people. 

8. How would you rate your overall experience?

Very good, opening night was very good. Even though numbers aren’t great, it's the first event and it has gone well. Today we had 30 people. For the time of year it is good.
