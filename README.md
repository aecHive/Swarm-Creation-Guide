# Swarm-Creation-Guide

## Purpose of this repo

A guide for hosts to run a swarm event. This is distributed under an open source licence model.


## Background

The aecHIVE community is holding its first event in Dublin in November Dublin 2019. Referred to as the "Swarm", a swarm is the event model that brings people together. We are open sourcing what it takes to run a swarm event so you can adopt the structure and hit the ground running with a _101_ style guide for organising a swarm event and how it fits in with the overall community platform vision.


# FAQ

## What is a swarm and whats its relationship to the AecHive?
* A snapshot in time where geographically localised aecHive community members can come together.
* Encompasses the characteristics of the AecHive community.
* An open and safe environment where competitors, users, partners can resolve wider industry problems and unite behind the same cause.

## Why Swarm - Bees do it!
The opening night on the inaugural event saw John Bennett from Autodesk Ireland take to the stage to give a welcome speech and shared a lovely analogy from his past as a qualified beekeeper with the crowd. It sets the stage for this project, and I noted the following points:
* He could predict a swarm would happen one hour in advance of the swarm due to the hum of activity. He compared this with the anticipation he had for the event.
* 30,000 bees could swarm at the same time cordination and synrconiation. He noted that this level of organised chaos amounted to success.
* An individual bee did not matter as it was a part of something greater. This selflessness would result in a greater good.

## No actually, whats in it for us hosts? Why Swarm and not our own "Hackathon"?
* The AecHive Swarm model is open source meaning that it can be forked and used as you require.
* Strengthen your localised community and relationships between innovators.
* Respond to localised community innovation needs.
* Dont recreate the wheel - Use an existing event model.
* Become recognised as localised commubity leader in innovation.
* AecHive supports you with the platform required to get you up and running.
* AecHive provides a legal entity that offers the financial resources that you require for handling sponsorship money etc.

## Why Open Source Swarm?
* Open source means that anyone can take this model, run it, iterate and feedback.
* First of its kind event model for AECO industries.
* The value of the community is in the connections. We believe that if we can make the model open and accessible, we can enable more swarm events and as a result, grow the value offered to the community.
* Opening the source for the event model will allow the community to help us engineer, distribute, test and validate the model. We want this to be owned by the community and grown to suit their needs. 

## Guidelines for swarming
* This is a grassroots movement. We are individuals at events. Companies and status should be left at the door.
* No exclusivity. Open to everyone.
* Enjoy yourself. 
* Please provide good coffee.

## What AecHive would like from you?
* Help us spread the word and build support for the aecHive community.
* Help us onboard new partners that can help your locality.
* There will be another swarm in your localisation.
* Contribute to the Swarm project if you think you can improve on it.

## What are the value propositions for registering/ attending a Swarm cluster?
* A great opportunity to apply focus to an area of work with others.
* An opportuity to meet the local community with with similar interests.

## What is the AecHive community platform?
* Global, online, always available group of innovators in AEC.
* A resource for support.
* A Slack group.
* A website with information about aecHive including planned Swarms.
* Dev.to - Feedback on ideas. Discussion forum. Blogging. Topics/ Tags? (Future)

## What can we offer your clusters?
* Use of the existing slack groups. Upon registration of a cluster a private slack channel is created for it.
* Guidelines for what cluster can constitute.
* Guidelines for cluster to protect ideas?
* Guidelines for a cluster leader?
