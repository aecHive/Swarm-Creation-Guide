### Background

This is a guide for potential hosts to run a Swarm event. Distributed under an open source licence model.

The aecHIVE community has held its first event in Dublin, November 2019 to great success. Referred to as the "Swarm", it is the physical event that brings people together. We are open sourcing what it takes to run a Swarm so you can adopt the structure and hit the ground running with a *101* style guide for organising one and how it fits in with the overall community platform vision.

### What is a Swarm and its relationship to the aecHIVE?

Swarms can happen simultaneously anywhere in the world and are a representation of a snapshot in time, where geographically localised aecHIVE community members can work on projects collocated. Swarms encompass the characteristics of the aecHIVE community and they are an open and safe environment where competitors, users and partners can resolve wider industry problems and unite behind the same cause.

### Why Swarm (Bees do it!)

The opening night on the inaugural event saw John Bennett from Autodesk Ireland take to the stage to give a welcome speech and share a lovely analogy from his time as a qualified beekeeper with the crowd. He noted the following:

* He could predict a swarm would happen one hour in advance of it due to the hum of activity. He compared this with the anticipation he had for the event.

* Up to 30,000 bees could swarm at the same time in perfect unison. He noted that this level of organised chaos amounted to success.

* That each individual bee thinks not of itself but for the greater good of the swarm and would be willing to risk their life for it. John mentioned this last point was not essential to a successful aecHIVE Swarm. 

These points set the stage for this project, and I noted the following points:

### No actually, what's in it for us as the host?

The aecHIVE Swarm model is open source meaning that it can be forked and used as you require. It will strengthen your localised community and the relationships between innovators. You can respond to localised community innovation needs.

* Don't recreate the wheel - Use an existing event model.

* Become recognised as localised community leader in innovation.

* aecHIVE supports you with the platform required to get you up and running.

* aecHIVE provides a legal entity that offers the financial resources that you require for handling sponsorship money etc.

### Why Open Source Swarm?

* Open source means that anyone can take this model, run it, iterate and feedback.

* First of its kind event model for AECO industries.

* The value of the community is in the connections. We believe that if we can make the model open and accessible, we can enable more Swarm events and as a result, grow the value offered to the community.

* Opening the source for the event model will allow the community to help us engineer, distribute, test and validate the model. We want this to be owned by the community and grown to suit their needs. 

### Guidelines for Swarming

* This is a grassroots movement. We are individuals at events. Companies and status should be left at the door.

* No exclusivity. Open to everyone.

* Enjoy yourself.

* Please provide good coffee.

### What aecHIVE would like from you?

* Help us spread the word and build support for the aecHIVE community.

* Help us onboard new partners that can help your locality.

* There will be another Swarm in your localisation.

* Contribute to the Swarm project if you think you can improve on it.

### What are the value propositions for registering/ attending a Swarm cluster?

* A great opportunity to apply focus to an area of work with others.

* An opportuity to meet the local community with with similar interests.

### What is the aecHIVE community platform?

* Global, online, always available group of innovators in AEC.

* A resource for support.

* A Slack group.

* A website with information about aecHIVE including planned Swarms.

* Dev.to - Feedback on ideas. Discussion forum. Blogging. Topics/ Tags? (Future)

### What can aecHIVE offer your clusters?

* Use of the existing slack groups. Upon registration of a cluster a private slack channel is created for it.

* Guidelines for what cluster can constitute.

* Guidelines for cluster to protect ideas?

* Guidelines for a cluster leader?
