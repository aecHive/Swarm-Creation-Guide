As the host to the Dublin Swarm we are interested in asking you a few questions about your experience:

1. What did you find the biggest challenge?

Lack of time, time of the year (lots of events have happened in the last few weeks, september, October & November are really busy months). End of November/December might be better. Maybe one before summer and one before Christmas? 

Different countries would have different times of the year that are more or less suitable - so check!

2. How do you feel that aecHIVE could have better assisted you?

CiTa had to spend a lot of time re-doing the website as information was missing (no detailed programme), paid event/tickets (if paid websites need to be linked - CiTa had aecHIVE website linked to join the clusters etc but aecHIVE site had not mentioned CiTa or sponsorship/sponsorship packages.

More help given to cluster leaders to find members/help them in any other way. If there had been more time we could have promoted the clusters so more people would have seen them and possibly joined. 

3. What value has running the Dublin Swarm done for Cita?

Next year CiTa are running lots of Tech events so it was good for them to see Mercury (one of their member companies) and Evercam. Good experience for them. 

4. From your experienced today so far how could the Swarm event have been improved?

More people. However as the first event, now the ice has been broken and the people that attended will spread the word. Get the attendees to give feedback and we could use in the next marketing campaign. Always think about the next event re feedback.

5. Could the aecHIVE offer Cita any assistance going forward with regards to this swarm? (Tweeting/blog post etc)

CiTa have been tweeting throughout the weekend and early next week will send out an email after event - thank you for attending, photos, project, feedback

6. How do you envision the future relationship with Cita and aecHIVE?

Need to sit down and figure out what aecHIVE wants to achieve for the next event. E.g. Prizes that are relevant to the event.  

7. Top three tips for future hosts?

1. Focus on what you would like to achieve - do you want people all working on projects?

2. Get  sponsor that relates to the event.

3. Time! Time is key :) and be very organised - hold meetings, do to-do lists and  assign tasks to people. 

8. How would you rate your overall experience?

Very good, opening night was very good. Even though numbers arenâ€™t great, it's the first event and it has gone well. Today we had 30 people. For the time of year it is good.
